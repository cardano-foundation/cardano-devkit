# Product Specification

A personal blockchain solution for accelerating Cardano application development. This desktop application empowers users to set up and manage local Cardano development network, creating an environment for building, deploying, and testing applications.

Additionally, users can fund addresses directly within the app and monitor transactions as they’re confirmed in each block. This real-time block inspection provides insights into transaction processing, enabling users to track the flow and validation of funds as they progress through the network. By offering a comprehensive simulation of real blockchain operations in a controlled environment, this tool streamlines the development workflow—from prototyping to final testing—helping developers reduce time to market and ensure stability and performance before mainnet deployment.
